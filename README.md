# Chronicling_America_Flutter_App

## Overview

This Flutter application displays data from the Chronicling America API and integrates text-to-speech functionality. It features a scrollable list with infinite scrolling and supports refreshing and retrying data fetching. The app also allows users to play or pause text-to-speech for each item in the list.

## Features

- **Infinite Scrolling(Pagination):** Automatically fetch more data as the user scrolls to the bottom of the list.
- **Refresh:** Pull-to-refresh functionality to reload data.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Play and pause audio for list items using the `flutter_tts` package.
- **Retry option:** Allows users to attempt reloading data after an error occurs.

### Code Explanation

HomeProvider

The HomeProvider class manages the state of the data fetching process. It handles:

Initial data loading and pagination.

State management for loading indicators and error handling.

Interacting with the ApiService to fetch data.

ApiService

The ApiService class is responsible for making HTTP requests to the Chronicling America API. It:

Uses the Dio package for network operations.

Handles errors and logs the results.

Processes API responses and manages error handling.

AudioService

The AudioService class manages text-to-speech functionality using the flutter_tts package. It:

Provides methods to speak, pause, and manage the current text and state.

Notifies listeners about changes in playback state.

HomeScreen

The HomeScreen class is the main UI for displaying data. It:

Uses a Consumer widget to listen to changes in the HomeProvider and AudioService.

Implements infinite scrolling and pull-to-refresh.

Allows users to play and pause text-to-speech for each item in the list.

Logging

Logging is integrated using the logger package to track execution flow and record errors. Key logging points include:

Data fetching start and end.

Errors during API requests or text-to-speech operations.

User interactions such as button presses and state changes.
